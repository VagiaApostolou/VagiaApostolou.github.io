  <p style="font-family:arial;">First, let me tell you about myself. I am undergraduate student at University of Macedonia (<a                href="http://uom.gr">uom</a>) in the Department of Business Administration in Thessaloniki. I am 21 years old and my interests involve    subjects from Data Science. So, I think that you wonder what is the purpose of this webpage? I have two reasons for you. The one of        them is that, this is my first effort in writting HTML and creating by myself a webpage(and I am really happy for that :-)). The last      reason is that this is my final assignment in E-business lesson. I will explain you below all the details.</p>

  <p style="font-family:arial;">Firstly, the assignment is about collecting tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> via           Twitter's API. The Keywords that i have chosen for my assignment are #TheVoiceGr and #thevoicegr which is a greek tv show program.         From that program the winner is the best singer with his/her coach. For this assignment, unfortunately i will show you the diagram         only for the blind auditions from the players because live program didn't start yet!If you want try too, it is required to have           Twitter account and respectively in <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">Twitter API's account</a>. After doing account in Twitter         Apps remember that you have to complete and enable the appropriate fields, because you need consumer key, consumer secret and               access token.</p>

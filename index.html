  <p style="font-family:arial;">First, let me tell you about myself. I am undergraduate student at University of Macedonia (<a href="http://uom.gr">uom</a>) in the Department of Business Administration in Thessaloniki. I am 21 years old and my interests involve subjects from Data Science. So, I think that you wonder what is the purpose of this webpage? I have two reasons for you. The one of them is that, this is my first effort in writting HTML and creating by myself a webpage(and I am really happy for that :-)). The last reason is that this is my final assignment in E-business lesson. I will explain you below all the details.</p>

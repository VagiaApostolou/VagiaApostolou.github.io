  <p style="font-family:arial;">First, let me tell you about myself. I am undergraduate student at University of Macedonia (<a                href="http://uom.gr">uom</a>) in the Department of Business Administration in Thessaloniki. I am 21 years old and my interests involve    subjects from Data Science. So, I think that you wonder what is the purpose of this webpage? I have two reasons for you. The one of        them is that, this is my first effort in writting HTML and creating by myself a webpage(and I am really happy for that :-)). The last      reason is that this is my final assignment in E-business lesson. I will explain you below all the details.</p>

  <p style="font-family:arial;">Firstly, the assignment is about collecting tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> via           Twitter's API. The Keywords that i have chosen for my assignment are #TheVoiceGr and #thevoicegr which is a greek tv show program.         From that program the winner is the best singer with his/her coach. For this assignment, unfortunately i will show you the diagram         only for the blind auditions from the players because live program didn't start yet!If you want try too, it is required to have           Twitter account and respectively in <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">Twitter API's account</a>. After doing account in Twitter         Apps remember that you have to complete and enable the appropriate fields, because you need consumer key, consumer secret and               access token.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> So we find the data that we need. The next step is where we can store this big number of Data? Of course in one DataBase with appropriate structure of Data(key-value pairs). We are talking about NoSql database, the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDataBase</a> which we can install it free in our desktop. With my advisor's help <a href="http://kalampok.is">Evangelos Kalampokis</a> i follow the instructions and after installation in my computer i open the Command prompt and run the command "mongod --rest --jsonp" for storing the data in MongDB. Next, because we need tweets, we have to use the twitter package. After downloading it, we open a second command prompt and we run respectively the second command "java -jar TwitterCollector.jar". After that, i kept the browser open for 3 hours to collect the tweets and finally see the results. I would like to add, that i choose the Streaming API because i am interesting about real-time tweets. </p>

    <p style="font-family:arial;"> The only way to share your website is to hosting it in a server, for this case i am hosting my website in <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>. First you have to do an account repository and follow the instructions. It's very easy don't be scared :P.</p>
